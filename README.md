# Mini-Project-in-C-Contact-Management-System
Mini Project in C Contact Management System is a simple console application  without graphics. It is similar to the contact manager in cell phones.  In this project, we can add, view, edit, search and delete contacts. All added and edited records are saved in a file.  We can list contacts by name, phone no., address and email. File handling has been used to record all data. We have used data structure to store the user name, email and contact. Overall, understanding the simple source code of this project we can add, edit, search, list and remove data using file.
